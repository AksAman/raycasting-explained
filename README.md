# Raycasting, Explained

Many of us kind of jumped into gamedev without a solid understanding of these Physics APIs such as Raycast and Spherecast. In this tutorial repository I aim to make it really clear how each of the Ray, Sphere, Box, and Capsule casts work, look, behave, and how you can use each one of them to achieve your "casting" goals! 

The demo scene has 19 customizable scenarios to help you better understand how a ray, sphere, box, or capsulecast will behave in a variety of different configurations and environments!
